# Data-Visualization
In this project we will show our proggress during the course of Data visualization
There will be one (for now) main file that will contain all the steps code, and a file that contains all the support function.
In the main file each part will be seperated by a comment that will state its current step.
1. In the first step we read the dot file into our custom graph, visualized it and gave some further explanation about the time complexity and the Pro's and Con's of our simple algorithm.
