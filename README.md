# Data-Visualization
In this file we will show our progress during the course of Data visualization.
There will be one folder that will contain all the steps files (currently we have only one step = one file) and one folder that will contain all the data files along the way.
In the code/DataVisualAssignment.ipynb each part will be seperated by a comment that will state the step.
Explanation about what we did in each step in a nutshell:
1. In the first step we read the dot file into our custom graph, visualized it and gave some further explanation about the time complexity and the Pro's and Con's of our simple algorithm.
